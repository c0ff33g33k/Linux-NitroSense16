![Predator Sense](LinuxPredatorSense.png)

## Disclaimer:
* Secure Boot **IS** \* supported if you only use the ```acpi_ec``` package.
* Secure Boot is **NOT** \* supported if you want to control CPU voltage offsets using the ```msr-tools``` and ```undervolt``` packages.
* Using this application with other laptops may potentially damage them. Proceed at your discretion.

## Install:
- From the command line
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Packss/Linux-NitroSense/
cd Linux-NitroSense/
```

## Usage:
### COMMAND LINE
 - ```sudo``` is required in order to access the Super I/O EC registers and apply undervolt offsets.
  - From the command line run the main script as root:
  ```sh
  sudo python3 main.py
  ```

_[OPTIONAL]_
- Make sure to set the ```UNDERVOLT_PATH``` in ```main.py``` to the appropriate location of the undervolt package.
  - If you installed without sudo you can find where undervolt is located by doing.
    ```
    which undervolt
    ```
  - Next set ```COREOFFSET``` and ```CACHEOFFSET``` to the mV that you determined to be stable via throttlestop on windows.

### ICON
 - Alternatively you can copy the .desktop file to your applications folder and launch the program via it's icon.
  - Open ```nitro-sense.desktop``` in a text editor.
  - Set ```<path_to_NitroSense>``` to the directory where you downloaded this project.
  ```sh
  Exec=sh -c "pkexec env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY XAUTHORITY=$XAUTHORITY sh -c 'cd <path_to_NitroSense> && python3 main.py'"
  Icon=<path_to_NitroSense>/app_icon.ico
  ```
  - Copy the file to the application directory
  ```sh
  sudo cp nitro-sense.desktop /usr/share/applications/
  ```
  - Now launch via the application and on initialization it will prompt for the user password.

### NVIDIA-POWERD
- After switching nitro modes \* **YOU MAY NEED TO RESTART NVIDIA-POWERD SERVICE IN ORDER TO DETECT NEW TGP** \*
```sh
sudo systemctl restart nvidia-powerd
```
- You can check the current GPU TGP via
```
nvidia-smi
```
